# Project: Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

The goal of this project is to practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls


This project builds a web tool that uses the Aylien API to allow users to run Natural Language Processing on articles or blogs found on other websites. 

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

This project also uses Node and express for the webserver and routing, and uses webpack as a build tool.
